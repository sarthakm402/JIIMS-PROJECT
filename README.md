# Crash and Traffic Detection with CNN and OpenCV

This project was developed as part of Jim's hackathon and aims to leverage Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and OpenCV for detecting traffic conditions and identifying potential crashes from video and image data. The system is designed to enhance road safety by providing real-time traffic and crash detection insights.

## Project Overview

This project integrates machine learning with computer vision to detect and analyze traffic conditions and crash events. The system uses CNNs to classify scenes and identify anomalies in traffic behavior, such as sudden crashes or accidents.

**Key Components**:
- **CNN Models**: Pre-trained or custom-trained models for detecting traffic and crashes.
- **OpenCV**: For video and image processing.
- **Python**: The primary programming language used.
- **Transfer Learning**: Pre trained models to extract common features of cars.

## Features

- **Traffic Scene Classification**: Classify various traffic scenarios such as heavy traffic, light traffic, and clear roads.
- **Crash Detection**: Identify and alert on potential crash events based on visual cues.
- **Real-Time Processing**: Stream video input and provide live detection results.
